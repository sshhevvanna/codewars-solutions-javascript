/*Sentence Smash
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. 
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. 
Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is grea*/

//Solution #1
function smash(words) {
  return words.join(" ");
}

//Solution #2
function smash(words) {
  "use strict";
  var smashed = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    smashed += words[i];
    if (i != words.length - 1) {
      smashed += " ";
    }
  }
  return smashed;
}
