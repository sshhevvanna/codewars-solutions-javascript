/*Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]
i.e.
friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.*/

//Solution #1
function friend(friends) {
  let myFriends = [];
  friends.forEach((name) => {
    if (name.length === 4) {
      myFriends.push(name);
    }
  });
  return myFriends;
}

//Solution #2
const friend = (friends) => friends.filter((friend) => friend.length == 4);
